## List of a few services for emailing compaigns
[https://skillbox.ru/media/marketing/5_populyarnykh_servisov_dlya_email_rassylki/](https://skillbox.ru/media/marketing/5_populyarnykh_servisov_dlya_email_rassylki/)

First service in this list ([Unisender](https://cp.unisender.com/ru/v5/email-campaign/editor/157823999?step=send)) has actually helped me debug problems with loading pics in my companys service letters,
that didn't want to load on gmail and yandex-mail. It has free feature of eiting and sending html layouts right from your personal profile. So if you don't have private mail-server, this comes in handy.
